Follow up: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?

If the binary search tree is modified often and we need to find the kth smallest element frequently, we can use a modified version of the binary search tree called a self-balancing binary search tree (such as AVL tree or Red-Black tree) to optimize the search for the kth smallest element.
A self-balancing binary search tree is a binary search tree that automatically keeps its height balanced, which ensures that the time complexity of operations such as insert and delete is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is in contrast to an unbalanced binary search tree, where the time complexity of operations such as insert and delete can be O(n) in the worst case.
To find the kth smallest element in a self-balancing binary search tree, we can augment each node with the size of its subtree (i.e., the number of nodes in its left and right subtrees). This allows us to quickly determine the rank of any node (i.e., its position in the sorted order of the tree) in O(log n) time.
To find the kth smallest element, we can start at the root of the tree and compare the rank of the root with k. If the rank of the root is less than k, we move to the right subtree and update k to k - rank of the root - 1. If the rank of the root is greater than k, we move to the left subtree. We repeat this process until we find the kth smallest element.
Inserting or deleting a node in a self-balancing binary search tree takes O(log n) time, which is the same as finding the kth smallest element. Therefore, the overall time complexity of finding the kth smallest element in a self-balancing binary search tree that is modified often is O(log n).
