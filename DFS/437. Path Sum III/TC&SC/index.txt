The time complexity of this code is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because for each node in the tree, the pathSumFrom function is called, which has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case (when the tree is a linked list). Since this function is called for each node in the tree, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).

The space complexity of this code is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is because the pathSumFrom function is called recursively, and each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack. The maximum number of frames on the call stack at any given time is equal to the height of the tree.
