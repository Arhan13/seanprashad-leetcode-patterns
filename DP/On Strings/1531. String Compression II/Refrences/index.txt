compression(s, j+1, k - (j-i+1 - maxFreq)): This is a recursive call to the compression function for the remaining part of the string, starting from the next index j+1. The second parameter, k - (j-i+1 - maxFreq), adjusts the number of allowed deletions. It reduces k by the number of characters that need to be deleted to keep only maxFreq occurrences of the most frequent character in the current substring. Essentially, it's saying, "given that I'm keeping maxFreq number of a certain character, how many other characters do I need to delete?"
