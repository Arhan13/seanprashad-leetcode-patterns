The time complexity of the given code is O(nlogn), where n is the length of the input string s.

The code first creates a frequency array of size 26, which takes O(n) time. It then creates a max heap of pairs (frequency, character), which takes O(nlogn) time. The size of the heap is at most 26, so this is equivalent to O(logn) per insertion.

The code then repeatedly extracts the top k elements from the heap and decrements their frequency, which takes O(klogn) time per iteration. The loop runs at most n/k times, so the total time complexity of this part is O(nlogn).

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the code is O(nlogn).
