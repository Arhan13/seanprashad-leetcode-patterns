The time complexity of the given code is O(2^N), where N is the number of elements in the input vector nums. 
This is because the code generates all possible subsets of nums. 
For each element in nums, the code has two recursive calls: one including the current element and one without the current element. As a result, the number of recursive calls doubles with each element, leading to a total of 2^N recursive calls.

The space complexity of the code is O(N), 
where N is the number of elements in the input vector nums. 
This is because the code uses additional space to store the subsets in the ans vector and the available numbers in the availNums vector. 
The size of these vectors can be at most N, as it depends on the number of elements in nums. 
The recursion depth is also at most N, as the code goes through each element of nums in the recursive calls. 
Hence, the overall space complexity is O(N).
