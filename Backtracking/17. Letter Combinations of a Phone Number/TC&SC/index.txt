The time complexity of the given code can be analyzed as follows:

The dfs function is a recursive function that explores all possible combinations of letters for the given digits string. Let's assume the length of the digits string is n.

The base case of the dfs function checks if path has reached the same length as digits (i.e., path.size() == digits.size()). In this case, it appends path to the ans vector. The time complexity of this step is O(1) since it performs a constant-time operation.

In the recursive case, the function iterates over all the letters mapped for the current digit (mapper[digits[index]]). The number of letters mapped to each digit is typically limited (maximum of 4 in this case), so we can consider it as a constant.

For each letter, the function performs the following operations:

path.push_back(x): This operation takes constant time, O(1).
Recursive call: The dfs function is called recursively with an incremented index (index+1). The worst-case scenario is when index reaches n-1, resulting in n recursive calls.
After the recursive call, the function backtracks by removing the last character from path using path.pop_back(). This operation takes constant time, O(1).

Considering the above steps, we can determine the overall time complexity as follows:

In the worst case, each digit in the digits string is mapped to a maximum of 4 letters. Since the dfs function is called for each letter, the number of recursive calls will be at most 4^n. However, the actual number of recursive calls will depend on the structure of the input digits and the possible letter mappings.

Therefore, the time complexity of the given code is O(4^n), where n is the length of the digits string.
