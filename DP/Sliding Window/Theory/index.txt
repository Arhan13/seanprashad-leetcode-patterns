The sliding window technique is a dynamic programming optimization 
technique that is used to reduce the space complexity of a dynamic programming 
solution.

In a typical dynamic programming solution, we store the values 
of all subproblems in a table or array. 
However, in some problems, we only need to keep track of a small subset of 
the subproblems at any given time. 
In such cases, we can use the sliding window technique to 
avoid storing all the subproblems and reduce the space complexity of the solution.

The sliding window technique works by maintaining a "window" 
of the most recent subproblems that we need to keep track of. 
As we move to the next subproblem, we update the window to include the 
new subproblem and remove the oldest subproblem that is no longer needed. 
This way, we only need to store a small subset of the subproblems at any given time, 
and we can reduce the space complexity of the solution.

The sliding window technique is commonly used in problems that involve finding 
the maximum or minimum value of a subarray or substring, such as the maximum 
sum subarray problem or the longest substring without repeating characters problem.
