The time complexity of the given code is O(4^(N^2)), where N is the value of the matrix size. The code uses backtracking to explore all possible paths in the maze. 
At each cell, it has four recursive calls corresponding to the four possible directions (up, down, left, right). 
Since the maze has N^2 cells, the total number of recursive calls can be as large as 4^(N^2) in the worst case.

The space complexity of the code is O(N^2) due to the recursion stack. 
The maximum depth of recursion is N^2, as the code explores all cells of the matrix. 
Additionally, the ans vector stores the valid paths, which can have a maximum size of N^2 in the worst case. 
Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(N^2).
