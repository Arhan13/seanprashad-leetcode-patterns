The time complexity of the solveNQueens function in the given code is O(N!), where N represents the size of the chessboard (number of rows or columns). This is because the function tries to place queens on the board in each row, and for each row, it checks all possible positions in the corresponding column. Since there are N rows and N columns, the number of possible arrangements is factorial(N), resulting in a time complexity of O(N!).

The space complexity is O(N^2). This is because the function uses a 2D grid of size NÃ—N to represent the chessboard. Each cell in the grid holds either a queen or a dot ('Q' or '.'). Therefore, the space required is proportional to the size of the grid, which is N^2. Additionally, the function uses an auxiliary vector of vectors to store the valid solutions, which can also contribute to the space complexity.
