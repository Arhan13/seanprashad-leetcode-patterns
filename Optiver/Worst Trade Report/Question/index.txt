Q1. Worst Trade Reporter
You are tasked with building a tool to analyze the profitability of trades (also known as "profit and loss" or PnL). For the purpose of this problem, every trade has the following attributes:

TradeID - unique identifier for the trade,
InstrumentID - identifier of the instrument that has been traded,
Buy/Sell - flag to indicate whether you bought or sold the instrument,
Price - the price at which the instrument has been traded,
Volume - the quantity of the instrument that has been traded.
Consider a trade with the following attributes:

TradeID = 5,
InstrumentID = Google,
Buy/Sell = BUY,
Price = 500,
Volume = 20.
It means that you bought 20 lots of Google stock for 500 dollars and the identifier for the trade is 5. Note that trades have a TradeID because there can be multiple trades with the same InstrumentID, Buy/Sell, Price and Volume attributes.

Problem Statement
In this task, you receive a stream of N instructions. Each instruction can be an update or a query. An update can be of 2 kinds:

Trade - Indicates that a trade has happened. Attributes: TradeID, InstrumentID, Buy/Sell, Price, and Volume.
Price - Indicates that the true value of an Instrument has been updated. Attributes: instrumentID and Price.
There is only 1 kind of query:

WorstTrade - output the TradeID of the worst trade for an instrument. Attributes: instrumentID.
The WorstTrade is the trade with the highest loss made per lot of the trade. To calculate PnL of a trade the latest price update for an instrument is used as the true value of the instrument.

If you sell 2 Google stocks for 500 each, and had the latest price update saying Google is worth 400, the PnL for the trade is (500 - 400) * 2 = 200.
If you later get a price update saying Google is worth 600, the PnL for the same trade is (500 - 600) * 2 = -200.
In the example above, initially we make a profier-per-lot of 200 / 2 = 100, and after the price update it is a loss-per-lot of 200 / 2 = 100.

In case of ties for the worst trade, output the latest one.
In case there are no trades that result in a loss for the instrument, output NO BAD TRADES.
Function Description
Your task is to implement a class that provides methods ProcessTrade, ProcessPriceUpdate, OutputWorstTrade. These method calls correspond to the instructions described above with the method arguments corresponding to the update or query attributes.

Constraints

1 <= N, TradeId, Price, Volume <= 10^6
It is guaranteed that price update for an instrument is available before the first trade on that instrument.
Input Format For Custom Testing
Input to the program is specified using a simple text format. The first line of input contains an integer N that denotes the number of instructions. Each of the N subsequent lines contains either an update or a query in the format below:
Updates:

TRADE <TradeID> <InstrumentID> <Buy/Sell> <Price> <Volume>
PRICE <InstrumentID> <Price>
Query:

WORST_TRADE <InstrumentID>
Some example inputs and their expected outputs are described below.

Sample Case 1

6
PRICE Facebook 80
PRICE Apple 120
TRADE 100 Apple SELL 90 2
TRADE 10 Facebook BUY 100 4
WORST_TRADE Facebook
WORST_TRADE Apple
Expected Output:

10
100
Explanation: There are 2 instruments (Apple and Facebook), each of which has 1 trade. There are 2 queries, 1 for each instrument

PNL from tradeID 100: (90 - 120) * 2 = -60
Apple price at the time of the trade is 120 and we sell at 90, so we make a total loss of 60. We trade 2 lots, so the loss-per-lot is 30.
PNL from tradeID 10: (100 - 80) * 4 = 80
Facebook price at the time of the trade is 80 and we buy at 100, so we make a total loss of 80. We trade 4 lots, so in total we make a loss-per-lot of 20.
For both Facebook and Apple, we do exactly one bad trade which is hence also the worst trade for each instrument.

Sample Case 2

10
PRICE Google 100
TRADE 1 Google BUY 100 10
WORST_TRADE Google
TRADE 2 Google SELL 102 5
TRADE 3 Google SELL 103 5
PRICE Google 98
WORST_TRADE Google
TRADE 4 Google BUY 101 10
TRADE 5 Google BUY 100 10
WORST_TRADE Google
Expected Output

NO BAD TRADES
1
4
Explanation:
First WorstTrade query:

PNL from tradeID: (100 - 100) * 10 = 0.
There are no trades that result in a loss (PNL < 0), so there are no bad trades.
PnLs before second WorstTrade query:

PNL from tradeID 1: (98 - 100) * 10 = -20
PNL from tradeID 2: (102 - 98) * 5 = 20
PNL from tradeID 3: (103 - 98) * 5: 25
Second WorstTrade query:

From the PNL values above, only trade with tradeID 1 results in a loss, so it is indeed the worst trade.
PnLs before third WorstTrade query:

Net PNL for tradeID 1, 2, 3: 25
PNL from tradeID 4: (98 - 101) * 10 = -30
PNL from tradeID 5: (98 - 100) * 10 = -20
Third WorstTrade query:

There are 3 trades (tradeID=1,4,5) that result in a loss and the loss per lot for each of them are 2, 3 and 2 respectively.
So worst trade would be trade with tradeID 4.
