The time complexity of the given code is O(N^target), 
where N is the number of elements in the candidates vector and target is the given target value.
This is because the code explores all possible combinations of the elements in the candidates vector to achieve the target sum. 
The code uses recursion to generate the combinations, and at each step, it has two recursive calls: one including the current element and one without the current element. 
This branching factor leads to a total of N^target recursive calls in the worst case.


The space complexity of the code is O(target) in the worst case. 
This is because the code uses additional space to store the intermediate combinations in the currentCandidates vector. 
The size of this vector can be at most target, as it depends on the target value. 
Additionally, the recursion depth is at most target, as the code reduces the target value in each recursive call.
Hence, the overall space complexity is O(target).
